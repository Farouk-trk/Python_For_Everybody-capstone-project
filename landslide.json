Gales lashed the Kepler, Routeburn and Milford Tracks in Fiordland causing flooding and land slips and two significant landslides blocked the Milford road.  ----- Multiple slips including a huge landslide at Lake Fergus, on the Te Anau side of the Homer Tunnel, also forced the closure of the Milford road.

      "event_description":"(Landslide may have occurred days before April 27). A slip just metres from the main road between Haast and Fox Glacier poses no threat to motorists, New Zealand Transport Agency says.  Locals using State Highway 6 on the West Coast said a massive landslide below the road near Knights Point had worsened since it first occurred four years ago.  They worried that if it gave way any further it would take the road with it, sending motorists into the sea below and leaving the West Coast cut off from the south.  However, NZTA's regional performance manager Pete Connors said the slip had moved very little since 2012.  He said it was being monitored by sensors for movement and moisture levels, and visual inspections were being carried out each week.",

The Marlborough District Council called for the evacuation after heavy rain on Tuesday night caused movement on the hillside. Up to 500 cubic metres of soil shifted, prompting the council to close off a section of the street. Civil Defence opened an operations centre at the Waikawa Marae near Picton where evacuees were served morning tea and lunch. Tracey Davey, at the evacuation centre with two of her children and mum, said she watched a trickle of muddy water running down a driveway across the road from her home turn into a muddy river. She looked up and thought, \"that's a slip, it's quite big and looking bad,\" so she went to the Picton police station then council office about 9.30am to let staff know. Back home, \"I thought I'd rather look silly and pack a bag than hang around if there's a danger,\" she told the Marlborough Express. \"At the end of the day its about keeping the kids safe.\" Wit",

Mr Dillon was \"a bit gutted\" that his \"man shed\" had been smashed to splinters by the mudslide, and he had lost most of his tools. \"There was lots of noise, it was a bit scary,\" especially for his two children, he said.

      "event_description":"A woman who was killed when her rented house was demolished by a huge landslide yesterday has been described as \"a tower of strength\". Jude Hivon, 63, was found buried in mud after the 200m-long landslide hit the rear of the house in Marahau, near Motueka, following hours of torrential rain yesterday afternoon. She was finally pulled free from the mud but she could not be revived. About 12 hours after the fatal landslip, a family of four in the same district had to flee from their home after a slip about 1.20am. (2nd article) The incident occurred at around 1:15 p.m. local time on Sunday when a landslide, covering an area about 200 meters (218 yards) long, hit near a road near Kaiteriteri, a coastal town on the South Island of New Zealand. It happened after more than 18 hours of heavy rainfall in the region. Koefoed said the body of the victim, who was identified as 63-year-old Jude Hivon, was discovered partially submerged in the mud.",

A state of emergency was declared after the storm, which brought up to 500mm of rain to some areas.  Central Hawke's Bay mayor Peter Butler believes three coastal farms he saw from a helicopter on Thursday had lost as much as 80% of their land through slips, which he says is a massive economic blow for farmers. …  A number of buildings may need to be demolished because of damage from landslides.  Civil Defence controller Te Aroha Cook told Morning Report on Friday the storm was similar to Cyclone Bola in 1988 though the damage has been greater for some communities.  She said several baches and other houses had been hit by slips and landslides and some may not be occupied again, while others may have to be knocked down.",

The slip happened on Otaraoa Rd, around 30km northeast of New Plymouth in Tikorangi, early on Friday morning, blocking both lanes of the road about 500 metres west of the Mangahewa Rd junction.  The woman driver, who asked not to be named, said she was driving to work around 5:45am when she saw dirt flying down the hill towards her.  \"I didn't realise but it [the slip] had picked up my car and was pushing me over, right on the fence line.\"  It was still dark at the time and the landslip meant she couldn't see the fence when her car came to a stop, leaving her panicked that she was teetering on the edge of a steep drop down the bank, she said.   NA Her husband was able to come and assess the situation and get her out of the car safely, but she and other residents in the area were fed up by the years of slips making the road dangerous to drive on, she said.

The fire service in Auckland, the country's largest city, reported more than 400 emergency calls in the 11 hours to dawn, including one after a cliffside house collapsed onto a beach on Waiheke Island. Two people were reported stuck up trees for more than four hours as rescuers battled floodwaters to try to reach them.  The Northland province was the worst hit, though gale force winds and torrential rain also lashed Auckland, the Coromandel Peninsula, Bay of Plenty, Gisborne, the Waikato region, Tauranga and Rotorua.  Police in many areas said roads were impassable and advised people to stay at home.  The MetService said the cyclone was moving away from the country to the south-east and conditions would ease throughout Saturday. ",

Police said no one was injured in the mudslide, which happened about 10am, and the cars’ owners were still on the mountain, but the ground was too unstable to attempt to recover any of the cars.  One car was still dangling in a tree this afternoon.  ‘‘It’s certainly pretty wild and woolly out there,’’ she said. ‘‘We had plenty of snow on the ground to start with, so hopefully the rain will turn to snow tonight and we’ll regain what we’ve lost.",

Engineers are waiting for the road base material to dry out and stabilise. The highway is the main link between the ACT and the Bega Valley where it joins with the Princes Highway. It is expected to be closed for weeks. Engineers describe the collapse as a 'slip circle failure', where saturated material beneath the road becomes heavier and slips away 'like the bottom falling out from a saucer'. When the material has dried out they will likely dig down to a solid base and rebuild with well draining material. The landslip has occurred below Pipers Lookout on a steep and windy section that for decades has been notorious for landslip and falling rocks. Unclear date or trigger for landslide event.",

The fire service in Auckland, the country's largest city, reported more than 400 emergency calls in the 11 hours to dawn, including one after a cliffside house collapsed onto a beach on Waiheke Island. Two people were reported stuck up trees for more than four hours as rescuers battled floodwaters to try to reach them.  The Northland province was the worst hit, though gale force winds and torrential rain also lashed Auckland, the Coromandel Peninsula, Bay of Plenty, Gisborne, the Waikato region, Tauranga and Rotorua.  Police in many areas said roads were impassable and advised people to stay at home.  The MetService said the cyclone was moving away from the country to the south-east and conditions would ease throughout Saturday. ",

This week, the organisation has had to move its rescue boat across the road due to another landslip on Tuesday. Norah Head Boating and Recovery Club members fear for the future of the club and for the safety of boaties if something is not done soon.  “Unless the problem is rectified, there will be greater damage to the natural environment and to life and limb.” Mr O’Keeffe blamed stormwater works carried out by the former Wyong Council for the landslips. “This is not coastal erosion – it’s the inability of the stormwater system to cope with the huge amounts of water we’ve had lately.  “We’ve built retaining walls and have done everything we could but still we get landslides.”",

She said she had been calling the municipality since the bank collapsed but found it difficult to get through to anyone. “I eventually called the police and they sent someone to direct the traffic.”  She said the water had pushed not only large amounts of mud into the road, but also a few rocks and a boulder.",

Under cross examination in Brisbane on Monday afternoon Senior Constable Darren Rumbelow outlined the difficulties he faced in securing helicopter support during January's floods.  Sen Const Rumbelow said in one instance emergency services personnel rescued two men who had suffered electric shocks in floodwater near the town.  The police officer said it was not until the men were further assessed at a local evacuation centre the seriousness of their conditions became clear. Sen Const Rumbelow said both he and ambulance officers at the scene made inquiries about organising a helicopter evacuation but were told available choppers could not fly at night.  \"I told them we need a helicopter as soon as they can because we've got a guy in a bad way,\" he said.

Heidi Hudson and her family were not buried, but they nearly were. Ms Hudson said water had started coming into the house. She had gone outside to dig trenches with her son Quinn, 10, when the mud came hurtling down the hill onto their house. There was no warning.  Zachery had been asleep on the couch. He went flying through two walls. ''I woke up outside,'' he said.  His sister Breanna, 13, has broken ribs after being smashed between a fridge, a freezer and a motorbike. His other sister Dorothy, 14, was silenced by shock.  Ms Hudson said she saw the children's father, Andrew Cook, 32, through the window when the mud hit.

The water hit it, there was a big wave over the top of the ute and that gave me enough time to run up to the bank.”  The roaring torrent swept down the hillside, carried Mrs Aldrick’s car down the driveway and pushed mud into their “totally traumatised” neighbour’s house.",

The incident occurred at Mangwaneni where the deceased Sema Bhembe was sharing a bed with her cousin who is also of the same age, Samkelisiwe Mavimbela. The mud from their neighbours’ house washed off onto the house causing it to collapse. \"We had to dig her out from the rubble which had completely buried her,\" said Ernest Shongwe who carried the deceased on his back to the road.

This was not a very large earthquake, and it occurred at 71.5 km depth according to the USGS, meaning that the impact was low.  It is likely to have generated comparatively low intensity shaking over a large area. On Twitter, a series of images were posted of the impact of the earthquake in El Salvador, a mining town located in the Atacama desert about 100 km from the epicentre of the earthquake.  These show large plumes of dust being generated in the mountains around the town:  Clearly there was significant landslide activity in this earthquake, although it is likely that the slides will mostly have been small and localized.",

They started digging on Friday but landslides have already started and water is gushing in at the 50ft deep site. Their quest has attracted large crowds of up to 300 people who have been following their progress, even disrupting the local football league game as spectators left to watch the dig instead. Police have been called in to watch over the men as they continue their search, even though they are excavating without a permit. Mr Diaz said: \"We are close. We have already hit something.

The accident, which occurred on the highway that links Teresopolis and Rio de Janeiro, raised the death toll in the southeastern Brazilian state from the heavy rains of the past five days to six. Mudslides forced the closing of the Rio de Janeiro-Teresopolis highway and Niemeyer Avenue, an important thoroughfare in the southern section of the city of Rio de Janeiro. The heavy rains eased on Saturday and Sunday, but a new storm rolled through early Monday, flooding several neighborhoods in Rio de Janeiro, knocking out power and causing massive traffic jams.",

More than 50 houses were engulfed as mud and rubble poured into the Morro do Bumba shantytown near Rio de Janeiro.  At least 170 people died after a week of heavy rain prompted mudslides and floods in Rio de Janeiro state.  The shantytown was built on top of a disused landfill which makes it prone to landslides.  Downpours that began on Monday afternoon set off dozens of landslides. Most of the victims have been the residents of the shantytowns built on the hills around Rio, Brazil's second biggest city.  Rio Mayor Eduardo Paes said that up to 2,000 families would be moved from high-risk areas, but gave no further details.  He said 4,000 families had been made homeless and 10,000 houses remained at risk, mostly in the slums where about a fifth of Rio's people live.  Brazil's national weather service, Inmet, said the rainfall has been the heaviest",

The cause of the mudslide is not known but the Globo TV network says it may have been caused by a backhoe loader that plummeted down the hill overlooking the neighborhood.

The leak occurred in the early morning hours of Tuesday, YPFB CEO Guillermo Acha said in a Twitter post.  An alert was declared on the Carrasco-Cochabamba pipeline due to the drop in pressure, \"which immediately activated the closing of the valves,\" Acha said.  Domestic gas supplies in western Bolivia will not be affected because although volumes will drop while repairs are being done, \"transportation is being optimized\" via the gas pipeline that runs into the highlands, YPFB said.  Two 26-person emergency teams will be deployed all day in the area where the mudslide occurred.",

The Council of Ministers has since allocated 180,000 US dollars to assist the villagers after an emergency assessment team had reported back. Our correspondent says no one died because a young local man had heard the noise of the approaching landslide and rushed from house to house warning the villagers.",

A mudslide killed four members of a family in Camaragibe, a city in the Recife metropolitan area, the Pernambuco emergency management office said.  A man was killed by a mudslide in Recife, the capital of Pernambuco, and a 13-year-old girl died when she fell into a flooded ditch in the neighboring city of Olinda. The heavy rains, which hit the region on Saturday and Sunday, caused at least 48 mudslides in Pernambuco, affecting traffic and the delivery of some essential services. Moderate rainfall is expected this week in the region, the weather service said. About 50 cities in Pernambuco were affected by heavy rains in April and nine municipalities, where nearly 15,000 people were affected by flooding and other problems, were declared disaster areas. Landslide occurred on the 16th or 17th. Read more: http://latino.foxnews.c",

Last night, Datar Balendung hamlet, Sukamulya village, in Talegong subdistrict, 120 km south of Garut, was engulfed by landslides which killed Wahyu of Cipasang hamlet, subdistrict chief Rena Sudrajat said Tuesday. The landslide had caused Talegong to become increasingly surrounded by landslides and mud flows, making the area totally isolated, and right now four locations were still covered with thick mud and killed three local villagers, two of whom were still missing. The subdistrict chief also said that the provincial road linking Talegong, Garut, and Pangalengan, Bandung, was totally cut off in the last eight days, causing a virtual halt to the economic activities of the people.",

In Sadu village, Soreang district in Bandung regency, West Java, heavy downpours caused a landslide which cut access from Bandung to Ciwidey, a tourist resort about 35 kilometers from downtown Bandung. Ciwidey is home to tea plantations, the Kawah Putih crater, Cimanggu hot spring and Rancaupas camping site.“We have been informed that the landslide buried two people on Sunday night. Considering the timing, they’re probably dead by now,” Sigit told The Jakarta Post. The two victims were identified as Rostini, 31, and her daughter, Siti, 9. Bad weather had forced rescuers to temporarily halt their search for the victims.  ",
